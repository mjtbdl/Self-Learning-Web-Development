# Self-Learning-Web-Development
This repository documents my journey of learning web development on my own. It includes all the projects I created while learning, as well as the corresponding worksheets that helped me reinforce the concepts. The projects cover a range of web development skills, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and popular web development framework, Bootstrap.
